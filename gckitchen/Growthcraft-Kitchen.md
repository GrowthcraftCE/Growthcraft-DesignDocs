# Growthcraft Kitchen - WIP

This module is all about processing items that Growthcraft produces. This is a realistic low tech module for growthcraft that contains Pioneer like items such as a Stove (as a heat source).

### Naming Convention

This module is named the Kitchen module as it will be intended to process items like you would in the Kitchen. This is inline with with the same concept as GC Celler.

## Module Blocks

### Pot

A brewing block that can be placed ontop of the stove to make soups and make a lower yield as the brew kettle?

### Growthcraft Stove

Interactive Block that produces heat. The GC Stove is similar to the vanilla furnance with the exception that it acts like a heat block. This can be used to heat Brew Kettles and Culture Jars. It will not convert materials like a furnace does. There will be two variations. 

* Wood Burning Stove - Accepts OreDictionary Wood and Plank materials only. Recipe: 3 Iron Ingots (Top plate), 5 Cobblestone
* Wood Burning Stove (Reinforced) - can burn all materials that a normal furnace can use. Recipe: 1 Wood Burning Stove, 5 Iron Ingots.

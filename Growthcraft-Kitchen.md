# Growthcraft Kitchen - WIP

*Disclaimer: This is a mod concept and merely a concept at this time. This concept might not make into fruition.*

This module is all about processing items that Growthcraft produces. This is a realistic low tech module for growthcraft that contains Pioneer like items such as a Stove (as a heat source).

### Naming Convention

This module is named the Kitchen module as it will be intended to process items like you would in the Kitchen. This is inline with with the same concept as GC Celler.

# Growthcraft Kitchen - WIP

This module is all about processing items that Growthcraft produces. This is a realistic low tech module for growthcraft that contains Pioneer like items such as a Stove (as a heat source).

### Naming Convention

This module is named the Kitchen module as it will be intended to process items like you would in the Kitchen. This is inline with with the same concept as GC Celler.

## Vanilla Items

## Module Items

### Growthcraft Cook Book

This will be the first attempt at making an ingame manual for GC.

## Module Blocks

### Pot

A brewing block that can be placed ontop of the stove to make soups and make a lower yield as the brew kettle?

### Growthcraft Stove

Interactive Block that produces heat. The GC Stove is similar to the vanilla furnance with the exception that it acts like a heat block. This can be used to heat Brew Kettles and Culture Jars.
